# Smart List

## About
Smart List is an app that helps you keep track of all the food in your kitchen. Never again will you have to go through your fridge only to find some 3 week old cheese that was never opened. 

## How to
### Step 1 - Make A List And Check It Twice
First, you add the items you need to your Shopping List and you "Load" the item once you have loaded the Item into your cart. When you're done shopping, "Unload" to clear the list of all the stuff you purchased which will also add it to your Kitchen.

### Step 2 -  Manage Your Kitchen
Once it's in your Kitchen, you can tap on an Item to edit it's details such as how much of that item you bought, the store you bought it from, when it expires, and any notes you'd like to leave yourself. When you set an expiration date, the app will send you a notification reminding you that your item has expired.
